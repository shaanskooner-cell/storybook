      Once upon a time, the second little pig decided he would build his house
      out of sticks. He did not want to work as long as his older brother, who
      was busy stacking heavy bricks, but he also did not want a flimsy house of
      straw. So he walked into the woods and gathered strong branches and
      straight sticks. He carried them back one bundle at a time, whistling as
      he worked. Carefully, he stacked the sticks into walls and laid more
      across the top for a roof. He wedged small twigs into the gaps and pressed
      the door tightly into place. When he was done, he stepped back and smiled.
      “My house is sturdy and fine,” he said proudly. “It will stand up just
      well enough.” But before long, there came a knock at the door. “Little
      pig, little pig, let me come in,” said a deep, hungry voice. “Not by the
      hair of my chinny chin chin!” replied the pig. “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll
      puff, and I’ll blow your house in!” The wolf took a great big breath. He
      huffed. He puffed. The stick walls began to tremble and shake. The little
      pig held his breath as the roof creaked above him. With one enormous puff,
      the sticks burst apart and flew in every direction. The house tumbled down
      in a clatter of wood. And the second little pig ran as fast as his little
      legs could carry him.
