      The wolf licked his lips as he left the pile of broken sticks behind and
      followed the two trembling pigs down the lane. Ahead of him stood a solid
      brick house, red and square, with smoke curling calmly from its chimney.
      The last pig was inside, placing another brick near the hearth when he
      heard the frantic knocking. “Brother! Let us in!” He opened the door at
      once and pulled them inside. One glance at their shaking knees told him
      everything. The wolf’s shadow fell across the doorway. He knocked slowly.
      Once. Twice. “Little pigs,” he growled, “let me come in.” The last pig
      stepped forward, steady and tall. “Not by the hair of our chinny chin
      chin.” The wolf’s eyes flashed. “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll
      blow your house in!” The last pig did not move. The wolf filled his lungs
      and blew with all his might. The windows rattled. The fire flickered. But
      the walls did not budge. Again the wolf huffed. Harder. Longer. His face
      turned red. His breath came out in angry bursts. Still, the bricks held
      firm. Inside, the last pig spoke calmly to his brothers. “Stay back. The
      walls are thick. I laid every brick tight with mortar. He cannot blow them
      down.” Outside, the wolf snarled in frustration. He pushed against the
      door. He clawed at the sides. He circled the house, searching for a
      weakness. Then he looked up. “The chimney,” he muttered. The last pig
      heard the scrape of claws on brick and knew at once what the wolf was
      planning. Quickly, he hung a large iron pot over the fire and filled it
      with water. Flames crackled higher beneath it. The wolf squeezed into the
      chimney and began to slide down, grinning to himself. Down… down… down—
      SPLASH! He landed straight into the steaming pot. With a howl so loud it
      echoed across the valley, the wolf shot back up the chimney, covered in
      soot and scalded pride. He leapt from the roof and ran without looking
      back. The last pig closed the fireplace door and brushed the soot from his
      hooves. His brothers stared at him in awe. “It wasn’t magic,” he said
      quietly. “It was preparation.” And in the strong brick house, built with
      care and patience, the three pigs were finally safe.
